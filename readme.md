# Minesneaker

A game where the player navigates from one side of a chessboard grid to the other whilst trying to avoid hidden mines. The player has a number of lives, losing one each time a mine is hit, and the final score is the number of moves taken in order to reach the other side of the board.


To Do
 - Implement player lives.
 - Implement a mechanism to ensure there is always one valid safe path from left to right. 
 - Implement and display score.
